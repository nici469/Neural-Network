MLFileReader ReadMe
the file checker cuts out any portion of the the data string array that
does not follow continuously from the first timestep. the discarded portion is not re-saved, and 
is simply removed from memory

The data ordering format used by the MLFileReader is given in FileArrangement.txt

outer applications that have data to be learned by an Ml should save the file and communicate with
MLFileReader, which in turn sends the validated data to the ML Engine (ReluRNN)

You only ever have to call three methods in MLFileReader
1. The Constructors
2. GetTrainingInput
3. GetTargetOutput.

all other methods are auxilaries and are called from the the pipeline generated by calling these 
three methods, particularly the constructor
